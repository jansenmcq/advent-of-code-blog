# What is this project?

I decided to work through the advent of code challenges from 2018 and document my work in a blog-like format. I'd like for this to be useful as a teaching tool, so my focus will be on explaining my thought process and approach, even if it means I have to work through several approaches before I get it right.

I'm using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) to display my blog, which I have not used before, so there may be some learning bumps.
