For each challenge I will create a blog post with my thought process, and an accompanying code file in this repository that will solve the challenge. This is not meant as a "cheat sheet." If anyone is following this, then I'm assuming you're doing so as someone who wants to learn with me as I go through these challenges.

## Organization

I've organized the tools for this project into several directories: 

 * **docs** contains the files to be displayed in this blog
 * **code** contains the executable scripts to
