# Advent of Code Blog

[What is Advent of Code?](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about)

I decided to work on the advent of code challenges in an ordered way. I'm starting after Christmas, so they're all available, and I'll take them on one at a time. Below will be a table of contents (once I get this github pages things figured out) that will direct the reader to the pages I've made for each post. For each challenge I will create a blog post with my thought process, and an accompanying code file in this repository that will solve the challenge. This is not meant as a "cheat sheet." If anyone is following this, then I'm assuming you're doing so as someone who wants to learn with me as I go throug these challenges.
